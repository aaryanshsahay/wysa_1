Baseline Model 

Poor accuracy and overfitting in case of deep learning model.

Since text messages are short choose rnn for text classification as its able to identify patterns in a sequential manner the best.

Overfitting can be tackled by :
1) Increasing data : Data was for one week, automate collection of data so that it collects couple months worth of data.
2) Decreasing complexity : simplyfing the model architecture also helps in preventing overfitting, however the severe lack of data is the primary cause for overfitting.
