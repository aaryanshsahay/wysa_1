I recently got some Zomato coupons from my office so have been ordering from this same place for the past week. 

Never had any issue until today when this guy started scolding me for ordering from such a faraway place. My area has bad roads, so he said its risky to deliver in such places and I should stick to ordering from nearby places. 

I told him that I have had multiple orders from the same place delivered to me in the same weather and nobody had complained so far. If he felt the delivery location was too far away he could have cancelled the order. And its not as if people from my area don't travel on bikes, he was making it sound as if he had to travel through a minefield to reach my home.

128,Non-Political,1361,0.93,True,,"It’s 8:20 in the evening. You’ve just got through the day. You made an honest day’s effort. To work out. To work. To make it work. You listened to colleagues, family, friends talk, express themselves. You kept your opinions to yourself. Except when you were asked. You did a couple lots of dishes. You watched the kids. Helped put them to bed. Listened to a partner share about their day, their fears, their aspirations. You planned a birthday party for the new nanny because that’s the gracious thing to do. 

And through it all, you observed without giving an inch to the monster within. The monster that’s just bored of all the bullshit. The annoying noises that you smiled and applauded. The absurdities that you’ve endured. The sheer scale at which neurotic and psychotic behavior abounds all around you. Everyone seems sick sometimes. Drowning in their sensory overload. Gazes forever locked into their indubitably pedestrian pasts, their insipid dreams of winning wealth or a slimmer waist. Staring at their screens. Like middle aged perverts at a peep show.

Now you know why your father would sit like a stone drunk or in front of the television set for two hours each night. Why your mother sat in a mild panic as she prepped the vegetables for tomorrow’s dal and subzi. Why they occasionally expelled unfathomably obtuse assertions as they loudly belched and farted in their banians, pajamas, and maxis: “we should drop a nuclear bomb on Pakistan!” “Someone needs to teach these Muslims a proper lesson.” “If girls don’t have any modesty then what do they expect boys to do?”  “There’s no point studying mechanical engineering. Not good scope like computer and electronics.” “So and sos son/daughter has completely ruined their lives. But choosing to study fine arts! Not even commerce!”

You used to think you were better than them. You thought they were trapped between the endless recounting of their past poverty and present day middle class-ness.. unable to give compassion. Perhaps they felt compelled to hold it for some future that never arrived just like the plastic bags that they kept stuffing under the bed. Maybe they needed to negotiate empathy just as much as they needed to haggle over 5 rupees worth of coriander. You thought you were classier. More sophisticated. 

You didn’t ever say that aloud. Not even to yourself. Because it’s not classy to call oneself classy or sophisticated. You preferred fancier terms - open minded, liberal, progressive, inclusive, atheist, feminist, body positive, woke.. and on and on the list of terms went, drawing an unbridgeable chasm between parent and progeny. 

Until today that is. Today you realized they weren’t drinking and droning mindlessly or panicking over the kaam wali bai not showing up because they didn’t know more about resting metabolic rates or the fundamentally patriarchal nature of Indian society. They were venting. They were in morose rebellion against the idiotic choices they’d made. They knew they had the chance to live a different life. And they’d blown it raising precocious pricks such as yourself. They were trying hard not to hate you when they plied you with desolate chatter about the importance of choosing Physics, Chemistry, Maths v Physics, Chemistry, Biology.

254,Business,764,0.96,False,,"Ex-Uber employee here. I hear a lot of anger and rants over the service which cab-aggregators provide in India. This is not a post seeking to justify anything or to make an apology. This is just an explanation of why things are so bad out there.

Both the cab aggregators in India face multiple challenges. I will lay them down below:

1. The pool for shared vehicles/cabs in India from which these aggregators can draw is not growing. The registration of commercial passenger vehicles may go up, but for cab aggregators, the supply market is very tough because (1) initial expectations in 2015-16 were set incorrectly which has had a cascading effect and (2) vehicles owners are happier pushing their vehicles into corporate cab services, which is huge in south and west Indian metros.
2. The churn rate of vehicles on cab aggregators is very high. Every week, a significant percentage of the vehicles churn out for various reasons - which means, in a year, the entire supply base in new. Maintaining service quality with such a high attrition is not feasible. Good drivers no longer exist and if they are, they are happily driving for corporates.
3. Driving is an unattractive profession, no one can stick with driving for long. It's back breaking work. So people tend to churn out. This causes problems with operationalizing a fleet. Even for large, well managed fleet owners on these aggregators, the average utilization rate in a week is 70-80% only.
4. Sheer economics is bad. In 2020, we knew that if a driver works 80-90 hrs/week and owned his car, he will take home around 20-25k at the end of the month after all the expenses in Mumbai - where the fares have traditionally been the highest on average. For other cities, it can be +/- 10%. The way most drivers see it, if they work this hard, they can easily make more doing something else.
5. Mistrust on both sides - drivers and vehicles owners feel that we don't pay them enough and cab aggregators feel that they are losing money on every cash ride. Drivers want per km rates to be be as high as 50 bucks/km - not to denigrate anyone, but many drivers feel that cab aggregators are get-rich-quick schemes and we can fleece customers for whatever we want. They don't understand economics and neither do they get demand elasticity. Cab aggregators are tired of losing money to drivers. How it works is, you pay the driver, the driver owes 20% of that to the cab aggregator. Now as an aggregator, I can get that 20% back only if the driver will personally walk into my collection center and give me that money. The way drivers see it is - 'why should I go and deliver that money, it is mine'. This is why can aggregators want to push for digital payments and drivers are strictly against it. This is the only reason why keep asking if you are on a cash ride and cancel if you are not.
6. We have tried to counter the 'cash problem' on multiple ends. We have promoted digital payments. Uber's payments, at least, are crystal clear and accurate (I should know, I used to run that thing pan-India), and we have on-demand payment as well. But nothing goes down with drivers because of mistrust and general hullabaloo about 'foreign companies are looting us' mentality.
7. Driver behavior control is now off the grid. The most potent way through which we controlled driver behavior was incentives. Incentives come out of the cab aggregator pockets - which they cannot do indefinitely. As long as the cash taps were flowing, the drivers were happy taking you anywhere, now they only care about making money on a per km basis - which works best when the rides are long or to the airport.
8. The cab economy is a function of network effect. The service can charge a fair price only if it can guarantee that any place on the network the cab goes, it can come back with a fare. General economics improves over time. With their denial to service areas perceived as unprofitable, the cab drivers shrink this network which leads to a deteriorated pricing and service experience.

There are other regulatory challenges as well, but I will talk about them some other time, if people feel like it.

I was complaining about how I have been getting really bad food lately, even from good restaurants - undercooked meat, sides missing, etc. The food I was ordering home was markedly different from the same dish eaten in the restaurant. This person disclosed to me that restaurants are fed up with price gouging that has been going on - apps like Zomato and Swiggy take upto 30% commission on orders - and so they don't think twice before sending out substandard food. 

They also disclosed that these apps threaten to suspend the restaurant's online ordering permanently if they reject orders, so even if they are overworked and cannot handle the orders coming in, they cannot refuse to take more orders, resulting in poor quality food.

(I'm directly converting the US Prices because we are going to compare it with each countries avg net income next)

Now,
If you're living in the US the minimum wage in populous states is around 12USD but let's assume you're doing a job in which you have a degree and not flipping burgers, still I'll keep it to the minimum, let's say you make 15USD/Hr

On Indian side I'm aware that Wearhouse/Logistics jobs in Ahemdabad, Gujarat
Pay around 30k

30,000/28 = 1071INR/Day round
1071/8 = 133INR round

Hence you'll make 133INR an Hour

800/15 = 53.3 
That means it'll take you to work for 53 hours to make the money required to buy an iPhone in USA

64000/133 = 481.2
And it will take you to work for 481 hours to make enough to buy an iPhone in India

53 hours of work in india will get you around

The contrast with Uber in other countries is shocking. You allow behaviour in India that would get a driver banned from the platform anywhere else in the world. Why is this? Do you even look at driver ratings in India, or at basic metrics like cancellation rates per market & driver? You station employees at airport pickup locations to help frustrated passengers beg and plead for their Uber drivers to show up, so you are clearly aware that this is an issue. Are you intentionally sacrificing customer satisfaction & safety just to win a driver retention race with Ola? Or is it because you think Indians do not deserve the same level of customer service that people in other countries get? 

Just a small subset of issues customers deal with in India. 

1. No driver will pick you up after accepting in the app. They will phone or message you first to confirm that the destination & payment method is something they consider worthwhile.
2. If you do not prove yourself worthy in the phone call, they will just sit on their ass and not move from where they are parked and having tea. They will not cancel the ride but leave you wondering if they are coming or not, until you waste about 10 to 30 minutes and cancel the ride yourself. Uber then charges you a cancellation fee that you have to dispute and get back in shitty uber cash or shitty discounts (not real money) if you are lucky. Uber does not allow you to rate these drivers who no-show. Uber even pays the driver a portion of the cancellation fee to compensate them for interrupting their tea to accept a ride that they did not bother to begin. 
3. Even if the driver does not call you to vet the ride, there is still only a 50% chance that they are going to pick you up. Many drivers accept rides that they have no intention of fulfilling. You are left to waste time hoping that they will come pick you up until you cancel the ride, and pay Uber & the driver a cancellation fee for the privilege. I've had the same driver accept and no-show a ride three consecutive times wasting over 25 minutes before I said f\*\* this and stopped a rickshaw. I got no response from Uber when I sent in a customer support email pointing out this drivers behaviour.
4. Most drivers will demand additional money in cash for parking/tolls etc. that are clearly included in the ride fee. The drivers will get very aggressive and make you feel unsafe if you refuse. I've also had drivers demand extra for the 'return trip'.
5. Drivers have unsafe vehicles. The cars are poorly maintained. I've been in some with non-functional seatbelts and broken brake lights & indicators. Do you have vehicle standards & do yearly inspections in India like you do in other countries?
6. Drivers drive in an unsafe manner. They are always on the phone. They speed and take illegal turns & one-ways. I've had two rides stopped by traffic police because the driver was doing something illegal. One of these drivers even demanded that I pay the bribe, because I was the passenger & clearly it was my fault that he was using the phone while driving.","Uber employees, why does Uber allow such terrible driver behaviour in India?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wi99od/uber_employees_why_does_uber_allow_such_terrible/,wi99od

And I cant stop feeling dumb for not being intelligent enough to read the signals of unloving relationships and for not being able to make anything substantial of my start up for 4 years. 

I have worked really hard on myself to be at a better place and undo the trauma of the relationships, dysfunctional family and everything else. But all of that is not enough because I am still in the middle of nowhere professionally. 


I constantly feel like I don't know enough. I am afraid of talking to men. I recently faced inappropriate behavior at my workplace and I further feel scared of talking to guys. And it's a man's world - how do you grow in the start up ecosystem, without being a part of the boy's club? 

I also have ADHD because of which I find it hard to focus on just one thing. I cant decide what space to work in especially after doing everything as a founder. 

My parents want me to pursue an MBA but I can hardly focus while studying. They have been mostly supportive in the journey and they they try to understand but they dont understand. They dont know about my ADHD.

I am lost now professionally. I don't know what to do and then I feel I am not good enough and that I am dumb because the work I do is basic. After running my own start up, I basically just do digital marketing for an org wherein I post on social media and handle their digital channels. The work is rudimentary and makes me feel stupid

68,AskIndia,140,0.89,False,,"Okay! So, i broke up with my ex few months ago and now when I look back I feel I used to ignore many of her behaviours which were potentially redflags. Also tell me if this revelation is common after a breakup?. Anyways, the incident goes like this. So there was this guy in my class who used to hit on my gf. I used to feel and now even more strongly that she was attracted to him to some degree. Ya! I understand attractions happen but whether or not one acts upon these attractions is what defines your partner's faithfulness. I did not like the guy for obvious reasons and I was very clear about this to her. Once we went to the birthday party of a friend where he was also invited. There he started messing around with my gf by clicking her random pictures and my gf was in response to that tried to snatch his phone in playful manner. I could see she was enjoying the attention he was giving her. Thats stopped me from confronting him directly. So, i waited to see what my girl does. I became silent. Did not react. And my gf kept on getting touchy with him. To the point she was holding his one hand at stretch while pretending to snatch his phone, whilst obviously she was enjoying all this. I felt so helpless seeing all this happen. Anyways, when the party ended and it was time to head back. She realised I was here too. Before that she was totally engrossed in him. I was fuming inside. I finally snapped. In such a way she never dared to even talk to him ever again. And it took me a few days to get over this incident and we were normal once again. Fast forward to this day now that we broke up, i realise or feel that she stopped responding to his advances only out of fear for me. Additionally she could not cheat bcuz we studied in the same class and spent entire day together at the Uni. So, if she ever tried seeing some other guy, it was not possible I would'nt know. Now, when I look back I feel she could have cheated me if I pretended to be oblivious to what she was up to. This makes me wonder If partners are faithful just out of the fear of getting caught and not because of the fact they value you.

20,Business,121,1.0,False,,"Nishith  Desai Associates (NDA) is an India based law firm specializing in  International Tax. It has pioneered the use of shell companies in tax  haven jurisdictions that can be used to hide assets and evade taxes in  India. In particular Mr. Nishith Desai the Managing Partner of the firm  was the person who advised the Mauritius governement to make it into a  tax haven in early 1990s. Mauritius then became a conduit for moving  funds into India and subsequently many African countries, and is the  preferred jurisdiction for money laundering activities in India.

Few  years back there was a major leak of client confidential data at NDA.  This data was eventually shared by a whistleblower with the concerned  law enforcement agencies in India (ED, CBDT and Black Money Commission).  The leaked data had details of how NDA had enabled its clients to  create off-shore structures in tax havens to evade taxes, hide assets  and launder money. NDA reacted by using its massive influence to scuttle  the investigation and hound the whistleblower by abusing the judicial  process to raid the whistleblower's house and seize all his electronic  devices.  The details of this have been published in a news story:

[India's 'Panama Papers' on shell firms, tax loopholes gather dust](https://www.dailypioneer.com/2021/page1/india---s----panama-papers----on-shell-firms--tax-loopholes-gather-dust.html)

This  whistleblower happens to be an accomplished techie and is part of a  network of hackers. This network avenged this humiliation and  harrassment of this whistleblower by hacking the servers of the law firm  and managed to get hold of more confidential data of NDA's clients.  There were some posts last year regarding this on a hacker forum called  Raidforum which has now been shutdown.

One  of the client was WazirX. The founders of WazirX have been very close  to Nishith Desai and his son Suril Desai. Both Nishith and Suril have  been at the forefront to lobby for legitimizing bitcoin and other cryto  assets in India. They have been championing the cause of the crypto  operators (including WazirX) and NDA had even represented them in  several courts. Nishith Desai sees crypto as another powerful tool for  facilitating tax evasion and money laundering for his clients.

The  NDA's data that the hackers got their hands on also included some  incriminating documents pertaining to WazirX. These documents have made  it to the agencies. The founders of WazirX have scooted off to Dubai,  and premises belonging to one of the founders was raided recently by ED.  The news report on that raid state:

>Investigators  believe Zanmai Labs -- the company that owns WazirX -- has  created ""a  web of agreements"" with companies in the US, Cayman Islands,  and  Singapore. The intention is to ""obscure the ownership of the crypto   exchange"".

So, first off, let me explain what an ideal environment for autistic people would be like. If you can have an objective, data-driven and truly meritocratic environment with maybe few considerations such as being allowed to wear noise cancelling headphones at work or dimming the lights at workspace, that's all it takes. Not to mention that some of these even benefit non-autistic people as well.

But the current work culture in India is heavily reliant on Chamcha-giri and ""networking"", areas where autistic people have zero chances of succeeding. The managers expect to be employees to be suck-ups and ensure all recognition and opportunities go to their chamchas. Managers have no inclusiveness training and have no appreciation for different personalities that they come across at the workplace (Some of them don't even have the basic civic sense. My current manager rants about Christians out to convert everyone, reservation system and his other RW BS directly in front of employees).

I have hope things would improve once organizations started adopting the 5-star rating system. Nope! Heck, I have seen people with high scores on this rating system being overlooked for promotion for years together. Despite the ratings, the authority to promote rests with the management, who only reward their chamchas and the sweet-talkers.

And BTW, I did nothing wrong. I was just enjoying my freedom of speech and expression—which apparently boys cannot do accordingly to teachers.

I know that girls have been subdued by society in having education, and the education system is trying to highlight this by mentioning this in the textbooks. However, that doesn't mean that girls would be able to enjoy high privilege and boys not. We're humans too. We have sentiments too which we have the full right to report if anyone hurt them. And it really bothers me that teachers are ignoring this (not only the female teachers but even the male ones).

Just wanted to get this off my chest. I know that some people have horrible teachers who get pretty physical and subject them to mental abuse (which is illicit BTW). And unfortunately, this is the norm. Hope that there are some actions taken toward these teachers.

About me : I am currently a 17 year old boy, and I don't know what to share else, sorry. 

I am sorry I didn't make it clear. I wanted to share my sexual abuse story with someone. Even writing right now about this is making me feel heavy and difficult to type. Actually I am afraid that if I just keep this to myself for forever I will die of some stress induced heart disease like most men do, I want to see that whether it helps a little to tell about it to someone , I want to see how it feels. It is actually the first time I am telling someone about this.   

First time.  

I don't clearly remember what was my age exactly when this happened maybe I was like 6 or 7 years old then. Things are still a bit blurry. At that time my family lived on another family's house on rent. The owner had 2 sons, we, me and my brother, used to play with them other a lot. They had a computer on which they watched movies and played games. Surely we didn't had those things so we asked them sometimes to let them play to. One day I was with the owners younger son. I asked him to let me play the game I think? And he asked me to something in return, things are blurry here, well he showed me some porn stuff in which women were doing something, they told me that everyone does this and it is normal, I was confused and didn't thought much and went ahead. Well he kind of lured me into sucking that thing, you know. Don't worry it was not something very wild or forceful I just went ahead did it mildly. Haha now that I remember it he had it very small, I think I am a bad person for saying this, so sorry. It was momentary just for a seconds, and after that I just went to brush my teeth and went back to normal like nothing had happened. I was confused as to what they were showing and why so then.  

Second time

Here also I am unsure of the age. I think it happened around the same time. This time it was with another family's son who was living on rent in the same building as us. He played with us for the most. Everyone in the building played together and inside the building. That boy was also older than me, not much but he was certainly. I remember that he invited me to his house we were both alone and he switched off the lights and took off my clothes and his. And he laid me down on the floor. And he kind of put himself on me, he said ""It is to strengthen our friendship"". I think he kind of dry humped me. He was rubbing his stuff with mine. I don't quite remember what happened but I just went back to my normal life, like nothing had happened, just a bit confused.   I don't clearly remember if any such thing happened again with me by them. I don't think so. Well sometimes, I wonder what if I am just imagining these things and they are not real. I still lived in that house for more than 4 years after these incidents. I don't clearly remember when but I realized what had happened to me when I was maybe 12 or 14. I don't clearly remember you see.  I am feeling very weird right now typing this, a kind of heaviness and very mild fear of something. It is kind of difficult to write my feelings. I am not crying but I wonder if I will if I said this to some one on the face.  Sometimes I feel like my mouth is filthy, it is still filthy. And I should keep it closed for the most. If I get into any relationship I wonder how I will show affection. I am filthy, I feel like I should not kiss anyone.   I am very cold and distant person you can say that if you look at my face. But I want to show affection , I am afraid that I will make the other person filthy too, by touching them or hugging them.   

These days I am having self harming thoughts, whenever I feel very unsafe, threatened and fearful. I haven't done this yet, I always stop myself by showing myself the photographs of the scars of ex-self harmers. Hahaha.

I haven't really posted my story ever on online before, I don't know how it is going to turn out.

I've never had someone who doesn't even know me just bring me food, and I believe it is his way of showing kindness and sharing his culture, I adore it very much.

I've been thanking him verbally a lot, but after the second time yesterday I also want to start giving him something too. I am a terrible cook (worse than you think), so cooked meals are off the table. I've already been told that I could also just spread some cut fruits on like a charcuterie board thing, with nuts or something - basically something with food that doesn't involve cooking, and I like that. I've also been told that mangoes are a big deal. Saffron, typical Indian fruits that I never even heard before, plants except white ones, (scented) candles and kitchen utensils are other ideas I've already been given. But I wanna ask here, what else are things that I could give him, either food or something materialistic/something else?

The thing is, he is sharing his culture, so obviously I could share mine. But I am German, and we live in Germany, and while he makes/gives me stuff that is hardly available here and I haven't ever had before, if I give him something that's traditionally German, it is kinda not the same, because that is available for him here and has been for the past 7 years he lived here. I am still trying to give him some things that are traditionally German, or some of the more expensive stuff that I personally really like (for example macarons), but in addition I want some more input or ideas - what would you like if you were in his situations, what are things that you'd miss if you were living abroad? What shows that I've put thought into what I give him and that I am interested in his culture?  What are ways to thank someone in India (I've read that thanking verbally a lot actually isn't that usual among friends)?

Hi,

I was coming home from the coffee shop tonight and was waiting to make a turn. I was about to make a turn from the divider and this endeavor driver speeds up and rams into my car.

I was trying to take the photo of the number plate and suddenly one of the drunk girls from the car gets down and starts abusing me. I asked, are you drunk, she hits my hand, leading to my phone being dropped. She again abused and slapped me.

Obviously I did not hit her back and the people around just watched.

She pushed my phone from my hands 3 times. I still managed to click a photo of the number plate and a nearby driver took the video of them running away. 

I went to the police station and they only filed a NCR report. The guy said that we are busy investigating frauds of crores and more serious crimes.

So essentially, it was a hit and run and assault, caught on camera. The location also had a CCTV camera in the premises of the building. I kept pointing that out to the policeman, but he ignored it.

I want to pursue this and ensure that this does not happen to anybody else and the people who did this are actually punished.

I am also concerned for my parents’ safety if the case goes forward (retaliation). What do you guys suggest I should do.

Pretty shaken up with the incident.","A drunk driver hit my car, was assaulted, they ran. Police only filed NCR report. What are my options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wjhy8p/a_drunk_driver_hit_my_car_was_assaulted_they_ran/,wjhy8p

I am also fairly intelligent I know. And I also know that unless I fuck up majorly, I should have not too much trouble succeeding in the corporate world. But despite all this, I don't feel at peace.

I keep comparing myself to my friends who are earning 12 or 14 or 19 LPA. Or my friend who is running his own startup. Or comparing myself to where I could have been had I studied a little harder, been a little smarter. And I don't find satisfaction in the money I earn.

I know, however, that I am doing fairly well compared to the overwhelming majority of the people in this country, especially at my age. I know that lifetime success has very little to do with how much money you earn at your first job. I even know that happiness and peace has little to do with money.

I can't stop fantasizing about the time when I will get a raise or change my job for a higher paying one. And I can't be happy. Honestly, I don't think I have rejoiced in my heart even once after I got this job. 

I don't want to feel this way. I want to be happy for myself! I want to celebrate that I am doing okay at least, if not good. I want to stop thinking about my pay all the time. And I want to actually like my life right now.

22,Rant,21,0.89,False,,"Hi all, 

TL:DR - today, on a busy road this guy bangs into my car real bad and damaged the trunk - the guy said will only give me insurance filing charges. And when I was being assertive, he called a lot of guys at the scene. Hyundai bodyshop says it's at least a cost of Rs 30-40K, if I claim insurance my cost will be Rs 3-5,000 + filing charges. **What should I do/have done? He offered to pay Rs 1,900, the insurance filing charges and Police backed him up. I didn't take 1900.**

Here's the story.... sorry, most of this will be a rant as I am super pissed at this point.

On a very busy street in Gurgaon, I am driving at the speed of max 20 kmph I am there with my wife and we just dropped our two year old son at his play school. There is decent traffic on the road and suddenly this guy (lets call him L) in a Fortuner car, banged into my vehicle, he must have been driving at least at the speed of 60+. Shaken and in shock me and wife come out and see this \~20 year old kid driving and his friend of similar age with him, I shouted at L which visibly made them angry. The other guy came out and told me to shut up unless I wanted a thrashing. This really shocked me as I was expecting an apology, they seemed to be from rich families (judging from clothing, car they were driving).

After the initial shock, the reality hit me (remember I just dropped my son - what if he was there in the car seat behind), that impact would have hit him hard) looking at the initial reaction, my first thinking was to avoid the conflict + I was also in a hurry to be at my work. I told L to pay for my damages and I'll be on my way. But then suddenly this third guy, who was not in the car came and started yelling at me & asked me not to bother them. His statement ""road pe gaadi chalegi toh lagegi hi - T: when you bring the car on road, it will get hit""... just then I noticed a series of cars stop near us- more young and healthy guys emerging out of them. This was at 12pm in the day I wasn't scared but all of them circling around me made me uncomfortable. Looking at this, I called the police helpline.

While all this going on, I spoke to L that the Hyundai guys are sharing their estimate of the spend, it will be Rs 25-30,000 based on the video/pics I shared. By now, I was overwhelmed by the number of people surrounding us and arguing on behalf of the guy. L told me that they will give me only Rs 1,900 - filing charges for the insurance. I said I need him to give all the expenditure that I bear (why should I forego my no claim bonus for his mistake) + the filing charges. They were super aggressive and said no arguments, it's 1,900 or I get a thrashing. Now here the Police enters & I feel relaxed, whatever their numbers, whoever they are - I am on the right side of the law right?.... right?

One of the police guy (lets call him A) joins the huddle & is immediately super harsh on me, I told him to take care of the crowd first as everyone was shouting at me. He didn't bother to do anything about that.  Then he started with the statement that I bothered them for such minor incident when the other party is till there to resolve amicably. I told him that their offer isn't good enough. To that he said ""ab kya aapko nayi gaadi dila dein"" T""should they buy you a new car?"". He didn't say a single word to the L.

I was so shocked, I tried to explain to him that I'll be at a loss & he retorts ""toh kya hua, road pe gaadi leke chalte ho, ye sab toh hoga na"". By now I was getting really late for work too... I said fine, just help me to get my damages if I make the insurance claim - 5-10k whatever it is (amount I have to pay as motor insurance doesn't cover everything right). and the Police guy just started shouting at me for being greedy. He said that the other party has been gracious to offer Rs 1900. 

 And then, a couple of Mercedes stopped and some more guys came there, they seemed older & calmer than the young ones. Told me that the boy will apologize to us (the 1st sensible thing that came from the other party) but when I tried to ask them for damages, they declined and said whatever Police says, the police guy started shouting & gave me number of some thana/station guy if I was not satisfied. I declined the offer of Rs 1900. and called the station master - he said the same thing.

**Now here's my question 1:** what's the guideline here, I always thought the hitter should pay the whole amount, why should I waste my insurance/no claim bonus for someone else's mistake?

Was the police right, just the filing charges are enough? 

**Question 2:** What can I do next? Can I even do anything when the Police even won't listen? I have name, picture, videos of the police guy for proof + pic/number of the car that hit me. The real shocker for me was: you wouldn't believe how nicely he was talking to the other guys, and what all he said to me. When I tried to record him, he shouted at me, for creating a scene there.

**Question 3:** what could be the reason was it that the the police guy behaved the way he did? I can imagine that the other party was influential/local (they all spoke in Haryanvi accent and seemed quite rich). 

**Question 4:** the other party was all driving super fancy cars, but weren't willing to give me any money, the best they could offer was Rs 1900, what could be the reason for that? Is that some principal thing or just showing off the clout? If I hit someone like this... I'd pay them for damages without much thought and I drive a Verna, they were all in Mercs and BMWs.",It's true - our Police is shit.

2,History,21,0.89,False,,"I tried gathering some information about ancestry of Indians. How accurate is this ?

&#x200B;

**Who are Indians ?**

India was populated through multiple waves of human migration contrary to the popular Aryan Invasion Theory. Most of the current day south asians trace back their ancestry to the Indus Valley Civilization who share common ancestry with Iranian farmers but their split occurred at 10000 BCE before farming took place. The split resulted in different groups of hunter-gatherers, one settling in  around zagros mountains and the other group settling in the Indus Valley. Both the groups started farming individually without being connected by substantial movement of people. Indus Valley Civilization one of the earliest civilizations on the planet mainly centered around modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan. After the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization 4,500 years ago, due to a severe drought that lasted for 900 years, IVC had to migrate to south and eastward regions in India slowing mixing up with Southeast Asian hunter-gatherer who already arrived in the subcontinent through the costal route during early human migration from Africa.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y8lrm3bc7kg91.jpg?width=395&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f5cb1fb1972ca02f757522a6e15c348694e353f

The Mature phase of Indus Valley Civilization traces that can be found in sites like Rakhigarhi, Haryana which is far away from original settlements of IVC like Harappa and Mohenjodaro indicate this migration. The DNA test of a IVC Skelton at rakhigari had a genetic makeup similar to Indus Valley Civilization and Southeast Asian hunter-gatherer to form what has been called Ancestral South Indians, indicating that IVC moved south and eastwards mixing up with South East Hunter- Gatherers. Notably the genetic markup of this subject doesn't have steppe pastoralist DNA which is associated with ANI and instead is much closely related to South Indian Tribal Population.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ey4ypsie8kg91.jpg?width=608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3e508617e445caaefea276ff528edfd349ce7ab

From 4,000 to 3,000 years ago, other wave from the Indus Valley civilization mixed with people of steppe-pastoralist who migrated from central asia, who likely brought horses and the Indo-European languages now spoken on the subcontinent, to form a group that has been called Ancestral North Indians. By this time the Ancestral South Indians moved further south.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jf7bpdpnakg91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e925c01e85cab4e83493f55abe048e678412f5

&#x200B;

These two ancestral groups then mixed as well, giving rise to the great diversity of ethnic groups in South Asia. Go back far enough, and both sides trace to the Indus Valley civilization, which appears to be the single largest source of ancestry for modern South Asians.

&#x200B;

This new genetic research explain the origin of the Indo-Aryan languages of North India, it also seems to explain the Dravidian language family of South India, which it traces to the Indus Valley Civilization but since Indus Valley Civilization language has not been deciphered yet, hence its a speculation of  a possible scenario combining genetic data with archaeology and linguistics is that proto-Dravidian was spread by peoples of the IVC \[Indus Valley Civilization\].

I am about to fly for the first time in 2 days from now and as the time closes in, I'm getting more and more anxious. Although I understood the basic procedures, I have some questions.

**1-** The allowed weight limit for check-in luggage is 15kg per person. I am traveling with my parents (on same PNR), so is the weight limit 15kg per PNR or is it per passenger (15x3) 45 kg in total ?

And also if we are checking in 2 big bags which may/not be heavier than 15kg individually , will the bags be charged extra or will they be treated under the total 45 kg **(IF)** ?

**2-** My SpiceJet flight is from Delhi to Bangalore, than after a waiting period of around 3 hours, I have a flight from Bangalore to Pondicherry (also SpiceJet) but different PNR/Ticket, So do I need to  web check-in again  along with luggage check-in at SpiceJet counter and also go through security check once again in Bangalore airport ***if not*** what's the procedure?

Also guide me if I am in similar situation as mentioned above but the second flight is from different Airline (indigo for example).

Sometimes I feel people use the term ""dusky"" simply to avoid saying someone has got a dark complexion (thanks to the national obsession with a fair skin tone). Frankly, I'd much rather people said ""fair-skinned"" or ""fair"" and ""dark"" etc instead.

Here’s a story of my Snowy Owl which is by far the best and most creative creation of mine I know this is hard to believe for all of you but It took me a month to complete this 7 by 4 Inches Small snowy owl. Now when I see this I realise that it was totally worth it.

Basically, it was in the Mid of April 2021 when corona was at its peak in Delhi and everyone was stuck inside the four walls surrounded by the negative news from all corners. Like all of us, I was also out of ideas couldn't think and felt exhausted without doing anything.

After a week or so I figured this out and adapt myself to the situation also made my mind to get back to work. I thought of making an owl which later converts into a snowy owl

I started from the basics by outlining it and gave the outer structure of an owl. It was predecided that this owl should be different from the real one but shouldn’t be totally fictional. It should be the one that made people think this even existed.

After outlining first I completed Its big round eyes which are the most catching part. At first, it seems something real is staring at you. Now the wings and the head were east to go only needed to figure out the perfect colour combination. All things were going pretty smoothly until I reached this middle part which was the most challenging of this entire owl.

After a couple of days a something unique pattern came to my mind, why not go with something circular. If you look at the middle part carefully you’ll see a circle that starts with little yellow and ends with a white shade  
Now this Snowy owl is on the way to its new home in Houston and I am feeling ambivalent when reminiscing the memories but simultaneously it's important to sell this to earn a living.

9,Rant,13,0.81,False,,"I am from Bihar and am going to tell a story. This is about my father.

We belong to the Yadav caste. Our caste main duty was farming and processing milk, mainly milk. Few of my ancestors are very famous.  One of them goes by the name Shree Krishna.

My great grandfather had 7 brothers. So in total 8 divisions of property. Then my grandfather had 4 brothers and 3 sisters, 5 divisions from here on as woman hardly get anything. Now in my grandfather's generation all had 3 sons, except the youngest one who had 2 sons and a daughter. My grandfather is 3rd eldest by age ie the middle  child of the property inheritors. My grandfather learned to read and write, while the rest if his brothers stuck to traditional jobs of our clan. After learning to read and write he used to handle all property papers of my family. If I ask his brothers today, they all say he cheated them, and he has. He let them farm in their land, only later when they discussed it with the official, the land was never in their name. Small portions were missing from each brothers land.

My grandfather started educating his 3 sons. My father was the eldest. My father was capable enough to do it. I have seen him at his harshest times and trust me he is like lava within earth. Hardly ever gets angry because he believes mistakes are meant to be made. Right now he is a senior engineer in the gulf. All his life he has done things on merit. Even I admire him. My father's immediate younger brother was dumb or idk. He tried hotel management, left it half way. Started a liquor business, drank it all. Started a bank, lost all money to bad loans. The youngest brother somehow survived to become a writer in a very popular newspaper these days, its one of the biggest in India. I say survive because according to my dad if he was that good he would have been way up in his industry but he hardly got promotions. 

Through all this the moment my father started working, he financed the family. Oh BTW he was married in 2nd year college. He financed the gas the fridge and all the business done by the immediate younger brother/second brother. He also partially financed the education of his younger brother. He even financed the marriages of both his brothers. He even used to give money to my grandfather and lived on the bare minimum with my mother. To give you context, my dad's first job in Delhi, my parents slept on the floors in the Delhi cold. No fridge just one small gas to cook and a blanket. While my grandfather used this money to buy loads of land in the village, they came dirt cheap back then. Most of the land is in his name, all brothers convinced he will divide it among them. This was in 1999. 

All through the years my dad sent loads of money even when he left for Gulf. In 2014, my grandmother got cancer and we did everything we could, but it wasn't possible. They offered nothing. My grandmother had cancer. And rumours in the village suggested, a few days before her death my grandfather had gone back to the village to buy more land with the money we gave him for treatment.

Meanwhile dad's immediate younger brother stayed in village as he stuck to getting income from farming and milking which included land bought from my dad's money.

Coming to recent times, in 2015, my father suggested we should divide the property, as I was coming of age and in the village marriage is done only after checking out the house. Official papers cost money. So most division is done in name in my grandfather generation. Land bought is on my grandfather's name officially. And other lands are on great grandfather's name. My grandfather's brothers think he cheated them, which he did. (If you ask anyone in my village, everyone's first adjective would be liar and cheat. He lies indefinitely even about things he doesn't need to). 

Now there are 2 types of land. One is fertile land one is for making house. You need both to live. So my grandfather divided the land in 3 parts, in which excluded land that he had already transferred to my father's immediate younger brother. My father found that unfair. He didn't mind the living area as it was one third. He was not happy with the division of the farm lands. Farm lands are much more in value to living lands. He said he should get one third because the land was bought only by him and grandfather as the rest never contributed any money towards home.

This was not agreeable to the immediate younger brother as he felt he had stayed and served my grandfather and gave excuses that he gave up things to educate my father. But if you ask village people, he was a drunkard who later gave up on it. Also he grew sandalwood on few lands and so he was like that is completely mine. Sandalwood is really costly. But my dad said that doesn't mean he can grow sandalwood all and and then claim it is his. My dad clarifies then take the sandalwood land and put it in total division and take it which means he will receive less in other farmlands. The second brother said no it should be excluded as that is his completely. But the brothers still signed on official papers except the younger brother who couldn't come due to a work call. 

A little background on the younger brother. He married a village gangsters chick. Then divorced. So in fear of life he would never come to village. And also he doesn't care about village property. So he rarely comes.

My dad was not happy with this. My grandad thinking idk what said he will make a new division of property after signing the PAPERS!!

He decided now there will be 4 divisions of property, him being another one. After his death he would give his share to immediate younger brother. To which my dad was infuriated. This would mean his 15 years of saving would go to his brother who had hardly gotten up in the morning. 

My dad made a house on the third of the house worth 25 lac, locked it,  while in the farm lands the immediate younger brother captured all and has been making quite the money as he uses labourers to do everything and take the cut. My dad couldnt do anything so he went to police. The police demanded a very high monthly amount for this, which he refused. He lodged a property dispute but our judiciary system is slow its been 4 years. Considering its farm land he doesn't even have to leave the farm lands alone. 

Recent news is, my cousin did 10th grade and left school, and is about to be married in a year or two. So now the immediate younger brother is trying to encroach the house . Village rumours are he is checking out the house and locks. While my grandfather is spreading rumours that we are one family  what belongs to my dad belongs to everyone.

My dad regrets giving all his savings to my grandfather. He never expected him to fall to this level. In his words "" I thought the lying and cheating was to others. Never expected him to do to me. I did everything he asked.""

Even I can't believe a father would that to his own kid. Needed to vent so wrote it. Thank you for your time. Pretty long and I changed a few years by 2 to 3 years so I don't have my extended family reading this.

P.s. I forgot to add in the last 2 years he has been associating with people from jdu party people. Jdu as in janta dal united is respected cm nitish kumar's party. My dad is scared he might use the the party influence on police and in court to get the house we made and also the land. This house will be used to claim it as my cousins house for marriage. Other people in the village tolerate him because he is the only educated one among the elders. My dad is scared he will never get to spend his retirement in the place he grew.",Trust is so hard to find. family vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wka8ca/trust_is_so_hard_to_find_family_vent/,wka8ca

4) Putting it bluntly,  I'm gay and I wanna fuck and get fucked by Indian men. What cities have the best gay scenes? Outside of that, how are cultural attitudes towards gay men in India these days?

The fault here is candidates from other than general (ST/SC/OBC) could go on the first date and get a seat when they could go the other date. Doing so creates lack of vacant seats for general students. This may sound minor but this is big.

*Skip to 4th paragraph for SSRI-related questions.*

Some background: I've had physically symptomatic anxiety for as long as I can remember. It was only when I was around 13-14, that I started to notice that I was having visibly distracting tremors and coughs in tense situations. However, as I said, it was only in tense situations like tests or right before an important result.

I spent the entirety of 2021 dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts alone. In 2022, I told my parents about the former and they suggested we go to our general practitioner regarding this. When I went to them, they prescribed me Fluoxetine. Looking it up, I found out it was an SSRI.

I've been on fludac 10 g for about a month now. I haven't noticed particular differences, apart from a shorter attention span, but comparatively reduced anxiety. I also noticed that my social life has an uptick. Although this, I've been a lot more sleepy lately, because of which I am losing out on time to study.

Are there any particular effects or side effects which I should prepare for? Also if you wish to, will you share your experience with antidepressants?

6,Rant,7,0.77,False,," 

As a millenial in India (or after them , Gen Z ) our problems are unique . It is unprecedented. Boombers or Gen X did not experience these problems largely due to absence of internet, social media, corporate culture & self help industry. Let me explain:-

**1. Boomers or Gen X** \- They were mostly farmers / businessmen only a select few were professionals or government servants. Population was not so much and floodgates of indian economy was not opened until 1990s (credit goes out to Shri Manmohan Singh, Economist) . There was no so much pressure to perform , earn and settle down. Inflation was low and consumerism was not so much. There was no shame if you could not 'outwork & out perform'. Nobody expected you to have a 3 BHK , Shiny Car and wear Silk. Life was simple. (Housing prices were also not so much)

**2. Self - help** :- There is a concept in movie 'fight club' that we are delusioned by self-help and toxic positivity. We miss living by 'hoping and striving' to reach 'just that accomplishment'. Heck, we even think that we can reach that golden goal . For example- Most litigators want to become as good as Palkhivala. We postpoe living. Many youtubers have commented on the toxic self help industry and criticized it. Internally, selfhelp books reinforces the negativity bias that we are flawed.

**3. Social Media & Internet** \- Everyone is a Start-up founder in linkedin and everyone is an IVY League Graduate. It has become soo stressful to open instagram or linkedin . Everybody is flexing.

**4. Corporate Culture**: We all want corporate jobs. What's the point of living if we wake up - go to office - reproduce and die ?

What do you think ?

Please tell me about Vu service and long term performance ; does it slow down like all Androids?

Seriously though, I'm not even that old, just 25 and I already feel so out of touch, out of place and awkward when I'm around or interacting with anyone born after 2005. It's like they're from a wholly different species than us. Some things I've noticed : 
  
  
1. **They're so easily able to speak up** : When I was their age, I would rehearse every thing in my mind before I ever opened my mouth. I would shit bricks during ice breakers. Interacting with anyone new meant anxiety. And yet, this new gen people so effortlessly are able to speak in public, introduce themselves easily, strike up conversations with random people within minutes. They just have so much confidence! 

  &nbsp;

2. **They're so comfortable with Social media** : I'm not a novice towards social media, I'm good with things like sharing photos on insta, or sharing updates on FB, or self-boasting posts on LinkedIn :P, but I just can't get my head over the ""new"" kind of social media - mainly stuff like Snapchat, TikTok or that Takatak and Chingari things. I can never imagine myself dancing on random songs and then posting it for thousands of people to see. I'd die of cringe and embarassment before that :(

  &nbsp;

3. **The new lingo** : I can't understand what these kids speak half of the time 🥲. Humara lingo used to be limited to using short forms like LOL, ROFL, etc. Nowadays there are so many short form interspersed between their conversations that uske liye alag course karna padega :). Another observation - lot of these kids refuse to use capital letters. They'll always talk in lowercase, without following any grammar or basic English rules. Not that's anything wrong in it, but feels wierd to read it .. 
  
  &nbsp;
  
4. **They're faaaar more intelligent** : Jo cheez Hume samajne main minutes lagte the, inn logon ko has kuch seconds main samaj aa jata hai. They're better at understanding social cues, at understanding emotions and expressing them too!

My father has always abused me, physically  and mentally all my life. Whenever I try to talk to my dad he's always like ""kis cheez ki kami h tumhare paas sab toh de rkha h tumhe. Hume itni cheeze mili hoti toh hum America me hote. Na tumhe khaane ki kami h na kapdo ki"" then he starts ranting about how much he's spent on our education (me and my brother's) Were not poor. When my relatives ask for money he can somehow procure lakhs (he's a big people pleaser). I know he's done a lot of hard work to earn his money and he's done a lot for us but sometimes it's just too much. I haven't bought new clothes for over two years now. I wear my home clothes to college. I have one phone that I've been using since four years now ( i recently got his old simcard bc i go to college) and a second hand laptop that I've been using for 3 years (only God knows how I type on that thing). I badly need another laptop or at least a tablet to do my college assignments but I got a ""no"" from him. (It's too much unnecessary money)

 Don't get me wrong. I'm not bi*ching about anything even if it may sound like that. I stopped asking for new things around 11th grade because thats when I started realising the abuse. I'm okay with the bare minimum because my father wants me to pay him back every cent he's spent on me once i start earning (yes he's said that over and over). my mother just blindly follows him. I just want to start earning quickly and buy the things I want. I'll not pay him back anything. The worst part is the emotional abuse. My father can never be wrong. When I argue with him he just always has to be right somehow. I bursted at him out of anger and that just made him hit me. He grabs my neck and pulls my hair. He uses death threats and always brings in the fact that he's been spending so much on us. if he didn't want to spend money on us why did they give birth to us? Everyday I recieve the comment ""haraam ka kha rhi h"" , ""bas sote h khaate h phone chalate h"", I'm so fed up!!

 I've always tried to make him happy. My life has revolved around making him happy since I was a little girl. I got 98.5 percent in 12th grade and entered DU. He always insulted my intelligence and rejected any opinion i might have. The only time I exercised my opinion was when I took up humanities (instead of science) in 12th grade because that's what I wanted to do. He then wanted me to try upsc but i didn't want to. He shattered my esteem and confidence so bad throughout school. I had severe anger issues lashing out at anybody who talked to me. (People called me scary)

 I only gained some confidence after having a fight with him. He had slapped me on the street in front of people for something I said jokingly to my bro (i don't remember what). He thought Maine unhe kaha hai. He just turned and slapped me, just like that. I was in 12th at the time and thought that enough was enough. Recently I have started to ignore his opinions and do what I feel but i had to pay a heavy price. I don't get anything I NEED anymore.  Everyone around me has always praised me and respected me but to them I'm a huge disappointment.

Trust me when I say that he's never praised me for anything. ANYTHING. parents at least love their younger child but my little bro's in the same boat except he has little more freedom to go out as he's a boy. Yes, I've imagined my father dying and thinking what life would be without him ( a paradise?) but my mom would be devastated even tho he's never really treated her with respect either. And I'll have to deal with my stupid, sexist relatives that will marry me off the first chance they get.

I'm afraid that's all people will look at it as.First off; he's very supportive and I've no doubt I can always count on him.

We're both sexually active, and always have had protected, sober sex. Thing is, after we had sex, a week later I was feeling nauseous and throwing up through the night.

It was probably food poisoning, mess food was making people sick. But it got him worried none the less. We took about 5 urine pregnancy tests the week before I was due (menstruating) and about 5 after I missed my date. They've all been negative so far. I should mention I got sick twice in July (before we had done it) plus a bunch of travelling and stress.

Don't know what to do rn. Need genuine advice what we can do now, or how to prepare for the worst.

EDIT: I went for the blood and urine hcg test at a gynac yesterday. The urine test came back negative in like 10 minutes. That still hadn't relieved me tbh; it was a strip test, and I wasn't even asked to not pee or drink water before it. Sooo, it wasn't all that comforting. I was counting on the blood test report that is due today.  
I was sleeping in my friends room because our roommates are home for Rakhi. Woke up at 5 to pee, and got my period! It was such a relief. Waited to vc him for an hour.

2,AskIndia,4,0.71,False,,"Please remove if not allowed. If allowed, sorry for the long post.

Recently, I have been going out more. Well at least trying to. I used to have a couple friends in my 1st and 2nd year of college that just loved to stay in the corner and not do much. As a result, I didn’t participate in things or go out at all.

I changed groups in the mid of second year (I’m in 3rd year now) and made good friends with people who really enjoy participating and going out. I like it as well. I feel like it helps me focus on other things besides just studying.

I started going to the gym with one of the people in the group and it has been like therapy for me. It’s hard to miss a day. And also, this person and I have become closer because we’ve been spending so much time together.

I also feel like I’ve been able to study a lot better. I actually passed in an exam that only 1/3rd of the students passed in (and I felt like this exam was the worst one out of the 3 other exams I had given). I have been performing great in vivas and 80% of the professors have told me that I’ve been doing good, at some point. This has actually never happened before.

The problem is, my friends like to go out and participate in things. But every time I want to do it, my family gets mad about it. They just want me to focus on my studies and not go out and do anything. Or if it’s not about the studies then it’s just “good girls don’t go out so much”.

If I ask about going out, I just get huge lectures about them. So I refrain 95% of the time and just say no to my friends instead. They do eventually come around about some of the things, but it’s not easy. All the time I’m thinking “am I making them mad?” “Are they doubting me?” It’s hard to not feel guilty.

My mother doesn’t like my friend who I go to the gym with because she likes to go out. She prefers I’d rather not have any friends than to have friends who go out.

If I get home from the gym at like, 8:40 pm, my mom gets extremely mad. She says girls who stay out so late are “awaara”. I understand where she’s coming from. I was a stupid teenager who did a lot of stupid things.

But I feel like I’ve grown a lot since then. I don’t care about boys or relationships at all. All I really care about is succeeding in college and my career and moving out of the country. And also focusing on my well being. I want to learn how to be an adult and I don’t feel like that’s going to happen if I’m constantly being told what to do and what not to by them.

I think about moving out of the country a lot and even though I am putting a lot of effort into studying, my personality is just trash. I’m not a confident person at all and I still don’t know how to communicate with people effectively. When I see people around me, it makes me feel terrible. Then I keep thinking about how I’m going to fail in interviews even if I pass licensing exams in other countries because I just don’t know how to talk and really have nothing to talk about.

I feel like going out actually helps me focus better because then I’m not just staying inside the house and actually having fun. There’s a balance. It also helps me learn how to communicate with people. I also get to decide about what’s right and wrong for me because at that moment, no one is protecting me.

All people in my class who score well go out a lot and participate in things. I used to think about how they managed to score well while going out so much. And I understand how now.

I could be sneaky about things but I really don’t want to. I understand where my family’s coming from but I also wish I was allowed to grow up, even if just a little. Any advice regarding how I can work on myself while not making my family upset would be appreciated. Thank you!

TLDR; family doesn’t like me going out with friends or participating in things. They just want me at home if I’m not at college. I enjoy going out. I DON’T CARE ABOUT BOYS so I don’t hang out with them. I care about my studies a lot. I feel like going out helps me grow as a person and have fun once in a while.

This was supposed to be a fun and chill vacation with my parents in a couple of days. But here I am super stressed and writing a post on Reddit.

**Context**

Booked a 6 day/7 nights European Tour for my parents.

Initially, I booked the trip for me and my mother and then later requested that one of the bookings be changed to my Father's name.

1. They took the initial booking amount but refused to start the Visa process. The reason being that their systems could not handle a name change(that I had requested) and I have to do a new booking. We lost around 20 days time waiting for them to communicate this to us. If I had known this was the issue, I would have just made a booking. They never communicated that this is the problem.
2. I had to literally follow up every day about why they would not start the Visa process even after providing all the documents. All I got were evasive answers. We had to push back the planned vacation by a month while we waited for Thomas Cook to figure out the issue.
3. Their internal teams don't communicate with each other. They have a Visa, Payments, Sales, Flight and a Backend team. It does not look like any of the teams have ever spoken to each other. Every time I called up one of them, they would conveniently ask me to contact the other team as they were ""not equipped to answer my queries"".
4. We requested that the flights be booked on different dates so that my parents could extend the travel. Instead, Thomas Cook went ahead and booked the wrong dates. We had to follow up daily to get this fixed.
5. We have been requesting Tour Booking details(Tour Manager, Hotel lists etc) for the past 7 days. Every day I get up and call up the Sales Rep and I get the same answers - ""Yes Sir, I will send it."", ""No Problem Sir, I will send it right away"". And then it's radio silence till I call up again.
6. They just told me today that the reason they are not providing Tour Details is because they want me to pay an extra 15K for the change of date of the trip. They seem to have forgotten their initial promise that there will not be charges for date change due to Visa issues.

These problems are just the tip of the iceberg. The sheer amount of incompetence is breathtaking.

I am regretting making the booking at all. With the amount of stress this has added, it would have been easier to just plan the entire trip myself.

Alright, back to it. So I was reading a news article recently where a doctor guy had some kind of family issue. So he drove to a star hotel in his city (large chain type hotel), booked a room and ended his life. Poor guy left behind a wife and kid (although they were separated I guess?). 

Anyway, it got me thinking about why people choose a hotel to commit suicide, and more importantly the aftermath. This isn't that uncommon either, we've even seen movies which have such scenes. It just seems so unfair to both the hotel AND the family. 

* Clearly the poor hotel would take a reputation hit for no fault of theirs, so would they demand compensation from the dead person's family? (not that it's entirely unjust). If not how will they recoup the losses?
* After the event, would there be like a media glare on the hotel? Reporters harassing hotel employees for details and such.
* What happens to the room itself, do they quietly clean up and make it available again? Or do they have to demolish it or something?
* How would budget hotels or lodges handle this, vs say a 4 or 5 star chain-type one (like say marriott or lemontree)? I suppose the impact on former would be worse than latter?
* Is there anything the hotels can do to avoid such a situation? Obviously they cant put a camera in the rooms to catch it before it happens. I can't think of anything.

But now that I'm no longer covered by the government and am married I want to understand how does the common man in India get healthcare both for acute and chronic ailments and for one off visits (like fever or  Diarrhoea)?

Few points:

I haven't heard good reviews about government hospitals like AIIMS, PGI etc. From what I've heard, they're **mostly overloaded with patients**.

Private hospitals in my experience just **seem to be a money making machine**. I had a friend who had kidney stones and he suddenly started experiencing a lot of pain. He took all his reports and went to Max hospital, and just to tell him that he indeed has kidney stones (which **he already knew and had the reports for**) they **charged him Rs 5k**.

So I travel a lot between the US and India and I have 2 phones – one for US and one for India (Airtel).

I am starting to receive more Whatsapp messages from India on my India Airtel phone.  Last month, I noticed that Airtel had charged me ₹649 for just 1 day roaming in the US.  They do offer international roaming for ₹3599 for 10 days, and ₹3999 for 30 days.

Now, the problem is that I only need to keep the Airtel phone on in the US to see if I will receive 1 or 2 important messages on Whatsapp, that’s all!!  I will not be using it to make or receive calls, or browse the net, or anything else at all.

In the past, I was never charged anything for receiving text or getting missed calls.  I am not sure about Whatsapp since I did not use it.

However, I always made sure I was connected to Airtel using my local wifi, and NOT using mobile data.

If I keep my India Airtel phone connected in the US using Wifi only, will I be charged these International roaming charges?

I bought a  pair of shoes from the Bata online website on 23 June and it was delivered 4 days later. However the shoes arrived in really pathetic condition with their material completely torn and withered. I quickly contacted the customer service and I returned the shoe the next day. It has been more than a month and still I did not get my refund. Their customer service is really pathetic.  I call them almost everyday to ask about the status of my refund and they are arguing that they have to send me a ""Pay-U-Link"" to initiate the refund. Even after waiting for these many days I did not receive any such links. Whenever I call, they say that the link has been generated and I will definitely receive the link within 24 hours. I will wait for that time, I will not receive anything and then I call again. They repeat the same song again. This has been going on for the past 30 days. I'm so frustrated with this irresponsible behavior from Bata, when I visited their Twitter and Instagram page to complain about this, I could see a lot of other customers with the same problem with refund. My advice to people who are planning to order from the Bata website, do not do it. If you face any problem with your order, you will not get refunded or replaced. If you really want to buy Bata shoes, buy it from amazon or flipkart, avoid their official store at any cost.

5,Rant,3,0.81,False,,"hello, i am a student in 10th. When i reached 10th i decided that i want to do engineering so my parents enrolled me in fiitjee and my preparation for jee started. I have always been an average student, i scored 85% in class 9 and i started my 10th with the aim to score above 90 in boards. i was consistent with my studies and i really thought i would do well until i joined fiitjee.

The syllabus in coaching is different from the syllabus in school. During my first pt examination i couldn't manage my time and had to miss many coaching classes. i tried to update my notes and watch the lectures i missed in between. I did not do as well as i expected in my pt 1 examination. I think my biggest mistake was not taking coaching seriously at the beginning. I focused mainly on school studies and did not do the packages that were given to us. So as i focused more on coaching i began giving less time to school. As the end of the first phase got nearer they also increased the classes to complete the syllabus. I reached a point where i became very stressed and even my mother noticed. I also started feeling more tired which idk why, all i wanted to do was sleep and it made my pace slower . I have a huge pile of books to finish, school, coaching, ntse but i dont have enough time. 

my first phase test of fiitjee is in a few days and i havent completed anything except physics. I know i will mess up very bad. When i opened my maths module, i started to cry. I love maths but the maths i do in school is so different from the maths taught here. Even now while writing this i feel like crying. I have my next school exam of 80 marks next month and i know it will be the same all over again. I have given up so many things i love doing, have to decline whenever my friends ask to hang out even though i really want to. But now i dont have time to do anything other than study with all the backlog i have. Sometimes i really feel i shouldn't have taken coaching this year and instead have focused on making my basics and concepts stronger, which is what i initially planned when i finished 9th. I'm always scared that i might do even worse in the future and i dont want to dissapoint my parents any more. It's embarrassing that i can't even do the bare minimum and maintain good grades after everything they have done for me. How will i learn in advance when i'm still trying to master the basics.

I'm constantly stressing and idr the last time i was able to relax. I'm fully aware that the jee journey is not an easy one. It requires hard work (smart work) and dedication and it was never meant to be easy. Basically im doing a horrible job at managing both school and coaching and i dont know how i'll do in boards if it continues like this.

That's why my father didn't love my mother coz she didn't know the ""rules"" and different sort of things when she got married and he continued having an affair with that married woman and my mother was totally unaware of that.We Have a joint family,my father and my uncle worked together.(My Uncle had only invested his money to start the business and told my father to run it when my father was reading merely in 9-10th class,My Uncle just used to sit and count the money)My mother is so hardworking and so kind hearted but my aunt, she always talked rudely with my mother even though my mother did all the household stuff.i was born a year later after their marriage.My father never cared for my mother.Although he did not hate her maybe coz she gave birth to me as my father loved me.He was a brilliant and hardworking father.(Still He was involved in the affair) Everything was Fine Untill When My Uncle shifted to Bombay Coz my cousin (his son) got a job there.He took most of the money as he was shifting and prior to this my father feared him as he is My father's elder brother but after this my father had no one to look after if he does anything wrong,He got along with some bad company and started consuming alcohol.At first it was ok but soon he got into depression and thus the business was shut.The first time he started verbally and a bit physically abusing my mother. One night He mixed sleeping pills in my mother's milk glass and told her to drink it, my mother slept and then he took the keys, opened the locker,took all the leftover money and some jewelry and Went somewhere with that woman.idk where.The whole town knows about this as my family was a very well known and respected family.After searching for like 20 days some contacts of my relatives were able to find him.(At this moment my mother already had went to her maternal house as nobody would ever wish to live with that man) He returned and i don't know what happened as i was so small at that time.He Went to my mother and begged her to return , My Mother Being a kind Hearted person was not able to stop herself and got back. Then my Father was in Depression and was underemployed,Was still consuming alcohol in heavy amounts. He started beating my mother and even me sometimes,My Mother Has tried several times to commit suicide and i stopped her, begged her to stop and now she is alive just bcz she loves me.My Mother again Had went Her home but .. He did the drama again and .. 8 years(My Brother was born after 3 years) went by , he didn't earn we merely managed to survive with the money we got from the shop rent as he was completed depressed and used to stay at home.He Then got out of depression and started consuming alcohol again but this time even drugs, gambling,and many other things i can't even speak about. Till this day he abuses the three of us mentally, physically and verbally.Am tired of this shit,Am in class 9th currently.What should I do to Just get him out of my life?

My entire life I believed in love evryone should get what they want and if another is unable, you should separate your ways.


A little about me, I grew up in a family where my mother was constantly being abuse both by my father and his in laws until she took a stand 8 years ago and since then she's been the one who is abusive. My father isn't a great man, he never was but my mom crosses line sometimes actually many times then I started feel bad for my father. Although they still live together but they haven't spoke to eachother properly and it's been 8 years.


This was my realisation period. I promise to myself I'll never be like my father and I will love my future wife with all I have. This was also the time when I started to believe they would have better had they divorced eachother because none them were happy.


This belief was solid in my heart and I thought love marriage will be a better option for me. I started to lookout for, not just for dating but also to have future with them as well. I had 5 failed attempts (2 rejection, 2 cheating, one was just using me as scape goat until she got married) before getting married and after every heartbreak I had very hard time to live normal life. Depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, guilt but with all of these I never brought my past with me whenever I was in a new relationship. I treated them with utmost care, respect, doing things they didn't asked for but love to. Never became an ahole right from the start. Never had any prejudice because of my past experience, heck I never told them how broken I'm except one and she cheated on me.


I got married this year (obviously arrange) after a long year engagement. We didn't speak much before marriage as I was really busy building my career and securing a good place. Soon after my marriage I realised how opposite we are to eachother. I try to do everything she like but she never shows any interest in things I enjoy but still it was ok ok I thought I had to compromise at least this much. But soon things started to fall apart. I was showing disappointment and dissatisfaction over things that I had in my mind. Things I thought should not be in my relationship if I want to be happy. I was outright blunt in this regard saying if we are not happy we should part our ways (my belief). We fought and fought a lot. She never stopped doing those things and I ignores until I hit my limits and then we fight again. 

All in middle of this I got her pregnant. I wasn't ready for this neither was she but insisted that we should keep the child, I agreed. But even after all these we still fights a lot. She started to remain sick most of the time and every time she becomes ill she goes directly to her house. One such incident happened back in April she was at her house I was at mine. There was a special festival in May that really wanted to enjoy with her so I asked her to come here, she declined by making things up. I begged her and my MIL but they still refused. I agreed on one term that she should spend the next day with me but she declined that too by saying it was the day she'll be spending with her cousins. After this I stopped picking up her calls and replying to her text. I was completely devastated and I separated myself from everything. Day before festival my mom and MIL fought and this was final nail in the coffin. She also stopped texting or calling too and I also accepted my fate.

About a month after our families met and solve the matter. We started living together until she got sick again and went to her home for over a month. She recently came back and went back again after getting sick and now she went for six months. Now again I stopped texting or picking up her calls but this time I just want peace and nothing more. I'll pick her calls when she needs me and not for general chit chats (I haven't told her this she has no idea why I'm behaving like this).

Some key points I should mention:-
- I have a habit to separate myself whenever I feel hurt. Like I mentioned that I stopped responding.
- I have suicidal thoughts everytime she rejects anything and she rejects almost everything doesn't matter how small it is.
- I have threatened/told her that I will divorce her.
- She has a habit of lying/acting to make things easier for herself. She always waits until someone say something so she can defend herself by saying none of these were her fault.
- She hides a lot from me. Like what she wants and how should we handle situations. 
- She always tries to make me feel guilty.
- My mother crosses line with her as well which she doesn't like.
- She's not working but also have no interest in household chores.
- I get happy if someone do something good for me doesn't matter how small it is and I always try to repay their kindness with more. She admitted that I don't need big things just small things but still refuses to do so because she doesn't like/have no strong reasons.



I really thought a lot about this and comes to 2 best solution but I can't do either of those. First is divorce which I can't give because she's pregnant. Second leave my parents home as she has no interest in household chores so she always tries to escape it but I can't do this either for 2 reasons, I don't want to leave my mother (I have few reasons which I think are legit) and second we won't have much to save after renting a house. 

What I want is not to get upset no matter what she do or atleast have no reaction at all. I really want to save this marriage. I also don't want end up how my perents ended up.

# Part 2 - THE MIDDLE CHILD : Doctors of the New Era 

* ECONOMIC DEREGULATION AND HEALTHCARE 1990s

Our country and it's healthcare was stagnant for the longest time, with medical services mostly restricted to government hospitals or few small Nursing homes. 80s -90s

This changed suddenly with the deregulation of the economy in the 1990s, although the process began in the 80s itself. A new era had dawned. 

**A : ECONOMY**

Medicine would now be called Healthcare to denote the change in leadership. Doctors running hospitals, managing protocols, setting health standards was changing, now private players could enter the market. But most Indians didn't have the capital to start a huge corporate chain or a large government hospital sized private hospital. But that eventually changed. 

Private players opened up hospitals in cities and now the latest modalities of treatment and surgeries were being performed in India. People no longer went to US or UK or Singapore for the latest treatment, or as can be guessed only the rich could afford some surgeries.   
The corporates took the burden of bringing the latest equipment and funded the training of medical and allied staff in some cases at foreign centers. I have personally met esteemed doctors who had visited Switzerland, France, UK, US etc and trained and even invented some new surgical procedures or techniques or materials used. 

Modern medicine progressed rapidly in this era. Indian doctors were always dedicated and hardworking but were not on par with those trained in US or UK, only because of lack of funds available to the hospital for such advanced training. But now, these techniques were brought to India by the visiting doctors and common people were finally able to get treatment, which was initially restricted to elite Indians or only First world countries.   
Many medical devices were Indianised. Some implants which were equivalent to Rs 100000 were attempted in India for 50000 and eventually brought down to 20000 (A huge amount still in 1990). 

This also spread the health burden and government hospitals too updated themselves with the latest equipment, trained doctors and good practices, although limited by funds.

**B : DOCTORS** 

This was an exciting time for doctors to learn new techniques and this era brought parity among Indian and Western trained doctors; since we were learning directly from them and able to replicate similar results back in India. 

There was so much scope for research and new techniques and materials were being made in India by many doctors. 

Due to the poor doctor-patient ratio, this was also a rewarding time for doctors who were in high demand which exists in some form to this day. Doctors were also paid handsomely at this stage, not at the beginning but as economy improved, people went for more advanced treatments. (Similar to Software boom of the 2000s)

Doctors at this phase had the best of both worlds.   
The values of the predecessors, the love and dedication to medicine instilled by the old doctors of the 50s era.   
The renumeration now went into lakhs and crores, due to the foreign return medical and surgical skills being so invaluable.   
The frontier was still being pushed and research was still being done in many new undiscovered treatments.   


In short, the doctors of this era had good values, good money and were daring and risk takers. 

**Important notes:** 

* **These doctors had seen both poor India and the growing India; so they never forgot their roots. They respected the values of the profession, elders and senior doctors.**   

* **They were not greedy as money was good and more money was not necessarily better at the cost of patient care. These doctors (not all) were rich but still worked 12 hours a day and also trained the next generation.**   

* **They took risks and pushed boundaries. If the patient was at the verge of death then they would do everything in their power and push the limits of science; which is done to this date but with caveats.**

This Rockstar image of a surgeon and the saintly image of a physician would soon change. 

We will discuss that in the next part and bring this conversation to the present age.

17,Rant,2,0.56,False,,"Personally, I feel like ""NCL"" and ""CL"" come off with strong negative connotations. Whenever I think about ""**N**on-**C**reamy **L**ayer"" and ""**C**reamy **L**ayer"", I immediately imagine a cake, dessert or something. The top layer of cake is smooth, delicious and soft. This layer is what makes cake a ""cake"", this is the reason why people love cake. Remove the cream and you are left with plain bread which doesn't have much value and obsession.

But if I were to draw an analogy here, the Creamy Layer supposedly refers to the that section of society which is at top, rich and powerful. Everyone loves this top section (layer). Just like no-one cares much about bread, similarly economically weaker sections of society shouldn't be given much respect? Just like we sometimes discard the hard crust of bread, is it fair to ignore and discriminate such sections?

The human experience of cream and bread doesn't really translate well when applied to economics and society. Are we really objectifying people based on a cake? Are we really implying rich people are far more superior to poor people? What's up with this internalized inferiority complex? Not to mention the subtle racism this term radiates. Creamy Layer is generally white and soft and Non-Creamy Layer is generally brown (black) and stiff.

What's the problem with using ""Economically Weaker Section"" (EWS) term that has neutral connotation and straightforward meaning? Conversely, use ""Non-EWS"" (NEWS) or ""Economically Stronger Section"" (ESS) for the counterparts. Why create separate derogatory analogous terms just to refer same thing that too in ""official"" context?

People have been using all sorts of respectful words such as ""hon'ble"", ""Shri"", ""Ji"", ""Shriman"", etc. even in official context but what's up with NCL & CL? And India is famous for showing respect to everyone even in informal language. There are hardly a few cultures out there other than ours that have two separate terms for ""You"" (*""Aap""* and *""Tum""*).

People nowadays get hurt or offended easily over seemingly minor things whether it be real life or online. Not to mention religious sensitivity, it's another ball game. But I haven't heard or seen anyone, whether in real life or online, who talked about said issue. I don't know how years passed by and no-one actually cared about terminology. It was only a few days ago when I was filling out an examination form and deeply thought how this is still a thing.

My co-founders and I are currently figuring out which city to setup our office and R&D space. We are a hardware company with quite a bit of software required to run our system. 

A bit of a background: we were all together in Bangalore before the pandemic struck and everyone moved back to their respective places and the last year and a half have been remote. Now we’ve been able to secure some funding and wish to expand. 
The issue is this: my cofounders are in Delhi , Mumbai and Bangalore. 
One of the cofounder believes Pune would be the right place to set it up. Keep in mind no one can really move to Pune due to family issues(I can’t due to my parents health condition). It would require all of us to extensively travel to Pune and I feel it’s pretty suboptimal to set up a company when you aren’t there all the time. I believe atleast one founder needs to be present at the office.
Second is talent. While I don’t doubt Pune’s talent, I do feel it might not be as wide as the other three cities. 

I’m of the opinion that either Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore should be the place we set up. Two of my founders agree while two disagree. 

I’m quite confused and was wondering about what would be the best way to approach this. Everyone is pretty divided on this. My cofounder feels if everyone commits 2 weeks of their time at Pune the issue is resolved. I’ve never had employees before and not sure how teams are setup etc. it’s all pretty new and something we will learn on the way. But I’ve spoken to a few of my family members and they all say it’s not feasible to 
1. Travel every 2 weeks
2. Not being in the same city as your office could pose a lot of issues.

2,AskIndia,2,1.0,False,,"So I recently bought a second hand car to learn driving and use it for a couple of years until I can afford to buy a better vehicle.

I got a 2010 WagonR. Though in 12 years, the car has only been driven 55k kilometres. I bought the car through the help of my neighbour's driver who is also a mechanic. He checked the car and recommended that it's good.

While I trust him, he has an equation with the dealer who sold me, so a secondary advice is always welcome. I've driven the car for 2 weeks now, and it works fine according to me.

However, I lack any proper knowledge of a car. I've never driven any other car before.

A few issues I found with the car.

1. The numbers which display the number of kilometres driven has disappeared for 2 digits yesterday. Like if it's 57289 kilometres, it just shows 289.xy (5 and 7 display has gone)

2. One of the door locks doesn't get locked with the key. So I have to manually lock it.

3. Sometimes when I accelerate, it feels car doesn't move as fast as I expect. Even pressing the full accelerator, the car doesn't go fast (it's also due to me learning the proper points to switch gears and I think that can contribute to it)

4. Sometimes when I reverse, the car just stands still. I have to reapply the reverse gear again. I applied it right the first time too (since there's a noise when reverse gear is applied). So a few scary situations where the car actually moved forward/stayed still while I had to quickly reapply reverse again.

5. Handbrake even if fully pulled leads to my car being pulled behind on a steep incline (unless I press brakes too).

My question is, are these serious issues? The car got serviced 2 months back (I have receipt from previous owner) so I was told to service it after 4 months (2+4=6). And what are basic tips I should know in maintaining my car. 

And how to find out if my car has a serious issue which needs to be rectified immediately to avoid any mishaps",Help with Second Hand WagonR,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/whz3z6/help_with_second_hand_wagonr/,whz3z6

she told her husband that she had only 2 relation before marriage but they were not too physical, and did it only few times. and she hid it for his peace of mind, and no other lie.

in addition she added that if he does not believe her and not let her come in bedroom then she will file case against him and seek money .

I don't want hurriedly change to bangalore as it is not very easy and i want to move to top company now like maang equivalent. The other day i told father and he was like do up down and frowned upon moving out, I had lots of fight with brother (with mother by his side) it drained me out beyond imaginable and since then I have started living on roof room and they serve me food. I am assuming I have may to move out as I want to see North mountains, explore my music channel options, perhaps date (havent quite done it because of my toxic mother) but fear they will stop me physically or fight.

I get depressed thinking about, I had gyno problem all my life got removed at 28 in bangalore surgery was disaster and i have never known what to do about it it's worse than before chest swells like crazy and all hard stuff that pains at 4 years, I wanted to go meet a doc and had to give an excuse that i wanted to return pendrive to office my brother said it's an excuse and got physical and i dropped that appointment with doctor. They have damaged me from childhoods I was in constant heightened anxiety and panic attacks till 19-20 kudos to them and this screwed my hormones at that time I got gyno, I had issues with ejaculation for decades snd I thought I had extreme pois I'm 32 and since I'm living alone I feel it's almost gone, my brother kept calling me names till date derogatory ones racial ones and used to broadcast to cousins and they and few of them called me too I was so insecure although I look like a bit of model lol, they think since they are pro modi they understand everything yes but only politics nothing else. Btw my mother father fought like dogs all our lives every or every other day, father was scientist and mother teacher, they are toxic beyond imagination (father in old age, mother always) , they are very narrow minded humans

I will not come back once I leave now, they ask me to get married but i am not gonna go meet jeevansathi girl pre planned my idea is to date and they think it's all pleasure and sex and it's evil, that's how immature they are at 65, and why I had POIS for decades even when I went to bangalore because it was embedded in our head loving is bad, I was going to be a high achiever but couldn't because of constant every second struggles of pois plus hundreds of their issues, then I dropped few friends I had from college as I thought their english speaking will cause issues with them or something. 
My mother and brother think I'm foolish to be looking for anything outside the family and it's all superficial they expect everything to be family and I defy that not indecently I have needs and wants what about my mental and physical health? then my mother tells me I don't blame you your grandmother was mad you got it from her, everyone takes money from them and go away people false praise them and they do love those glorious praises and then give away money. 
They made me lose my job in covid because they started long home renovation big one balcony around house and then everyday someone will take money and you will fight how much fuck I will physically fight brother he will call me names belittle me tell how great his our childhood friend is who is a unmarried shrewd low IQ pedophile, and disaster of surgery with hopelessness of a solution as no one knows what happened not to mention I'm botched (nipple crater) as well, I have had to put up with so much I'm actually beyond everything now I just want to live alone and I don't want to marry either perhaps move to mountains with my guitar. 

The thing is they will never understand one iota of anything. Btw I earn 40+ lpa only to only suffer in life even in bangalore just to save money they got me yo live with tauji so they didn't have to shell out, I wasted life there too. 


Please suggest the options, as they care nothing about my mental physical well being but at same time are busy finding elder one a match every weekend for 4+ years, and he rejects saying she had relationship, he wants virgin and looks of madhuri and they get their outing as well this way while I am in a jail, my mother thinks I'm mad yes I'm I love to learn music compose sing learn coding exercise she thinks I borrowed it from my grandmother, but I think she's the one who's mad, I also gained lots of weight when I came back and lost 14 lac in crypto scam all because they screwed my brain along with insane startup job and then they used to blackmail me saying I wanted to run away to us with a lady I was in severe depression for 5-6 months and every interview of 100+ interviews I gave I was tortured about the reasons for gap and i being truthful couldn't easily lie but I did and I was taken to last rounds and rejected or gave a different language job or same salary. mother brother they badly blackmailed and fought when they found out I had met someone on first solo vacation. 

Can't top this torture!! If it's hindu culture then screw Hinduism I will adopt no religion going forward I don't want these dumb people to be around me.

Does human life have a value or do hindus think to please their God the parents are allowed to screw children lives and keep them for their old age? Is there any law taking effect to honor a child decision? what stupid country do we live in? Before you say there are laws how to proactively get them to work? like I lost money in scam I got them arrested in their own country with no help from police 100 visits to them but they didn't open up the case the incompetent sarkari babus of honorable Mr. Amit shah!!

Why I decided to come here is because if I had to have a life when will it be if I allow a bit more I will be slave to my parents as none of this will ever end, what purpose does my life has, in all honesty I should have been the front man of rock band like queen cause I can sing both soft ballads to hard core rock songs which is a lost cause in India anyway

A friend (AJ) of mine of 2 years has gone MIA on me and 2 friends for about a week now. We are worried that something might have happened.

The last time me and my friend met him was at a night out and I dropped him off his home the morning after at 7am. He was fine then.

For context; AJ is an adopted son with 2 elder sisters and old parents. He's bi as well  as gender-fluid and came out to his parents which did not go well. He was studying abroad in Ukraine and had to return earlier this year because of the conflict. Since then he was in a relationship which ended tragically and AJ got more depressed. His parents have been ridiculing him because of his relationship, sexual preference and weed abuse that they found out about. They have seeker professional help but nothing worked and they just drifted apart. His mental health has been declining, he confessed about his suicidal ideation and thoughts of running away a couple of times to me. There is a lot more drama involved with his family and future education plans, which I'll skip just for sake now; you get the picture.

Since the last time we hungout I haven't heard back from him, neither did my other friend or his ex. His ex reached out to me two days earlier (we've never talked before this) asking me to check-in on him. They had plans to meet a day or two after our hangout in an another city where AJ was looking for College admissions. I reached out to him on WhatsApp almost everyday but my texts would stay undelivered for a while and his phone would be turned off. He might have turned it on some times and that's when they got delivered, and I never heard back. Same with my other friends. He ""seen"" a DM on instagram but didn't respond. Out of concern two days ago we called his dad and he said he's ill. Today we went to his place and he wasn't home. His dad said he's gone to stay with his uncle in a different city and they have seized his phone. I know that his uncle exists but the story sounded bogus and I felt that his dad was hiding something. I noticed that his bike(scooty) wasn't there and they have tied a cloth on the door of his room such that he cannot lock it. This was very suspicious and now I'm worried that they might have sent him to a psych ward or something has happened.

After few weeks, I wanted to check if its updated and hence clicked on instant e-pan on income tax website thinking that its similar to e-aadhar were a soft copy of the existing document is provided but later realised that its to create a new PAN by fetching all the details from aadhar.

So now there are 2 PAN cards on his name and the new one is linked to aadhar. Due to this we are unable to link to old PAN and to surrender the new one which is linked to aadhar, we need to go to income tax office and write a letter to AO officer to deactivate the new one.

Another option is to surrender the old PAN saying that its created inadvertently and continue using the new one. I wanted to understand if we are good to proceed with this option and also what happens to the previous records and ITR forms filed using the old PAN",Help regarding surrendering duplicate PAN card,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wj3okv/help_regarding_surrendering_duplicate_pan_card/,wj3okv

6. Are any gifts given to the girl's side relatives?
7. Anything that is a must-do, must-not-do, or is a good-to-do but not necessarily required?

Things I hate about US:
- They still live in the 90s
- High Crime Rate
- Raising family is very difficult 
- Bullshit Banking
- Access to doctor is difficult for small diseases. 

I am saying all these because my brother married a girl in USA and her family questions him now that he married her because she’s in America. Since I know my brother, I can say that he was an introvert and was nearly incapable of finding a girl by his own and at the same time desperate to have someone in his life. Arranged marriage is good in these cases, but if the girl and her family thinks this way, how can she even love him?

6,Rant,0,0.4,False,,"Indian parents are the worst. They care more about what people think than if their children are actually happy or not. Seriously. My sister has been at home unemployed for the past few years trying to find a government job and she is depressed and even suicidal at times. She tells me sometimes she wants to end it all. A major part of the reason is how unsupportive my parents are, esp my mom. She literally bullied her for the past few years, making living at home a hell because she thinks if my sister is comfortable at home, it would discourage her from finding a job. Lol. She is constantly taunting her, demotivating her, making her worthless due to her unemployment. My sister is gay and obviously my parents don't know because they will abuse tf out of her if they come to know. They have been presusrizing her to get married, commenting on her weight and complexion, shaming her for being dark(which she can't help?), fat shaming her and telling her to lose weight. She is so depressed and they create such a hostile environment that it is actually hindering her from getting a job because she is so stressed rather than helping her. I just came back home after my college ended, like I didn't didn't receive a graduation certificate yet. I got placed but it was a shitty job with low package I was not keen on, in a city where I have a lot of traumatic memories due to it being the place where I was sexually abused. I had meltdowns everyday as the onboarding date got near and gave it up after I had the worst anxiety attack of life and decided it was not worth it. That was two days ago, I'm working hard to find a job now and my mom is acting so mean and vindictive. She is taunting me constantly, like give me sometime I didn't even graduate yet. She is not talking to me, not even acknowledging my presence and when I told her I was not going for the job, her reply was ""but I told everyone that you were"". She DOES NOT care that I will be unhappy and mentally fucked up, she cares about what she will say to these people now like look at the priorities. Anyway, I need to get out of this hellhole fast. I haven't been interacting with my parents since the past few years and I just stay locked in my room because they don't understand me or my mental health at all. I wanted to take time to explore and figure out what career I would like to do but my mom gives me zero time for it. She forced me to do masters right after my bachelor's when I was confused about my career path and even though I was not keen on it. The result? I spent the first year of my PRACTICAL course at home due to lockdown. Like what a waste of money and I learnt nothing too. I'm just so done with her. Indian parents try to care but they don't know how to. Worst part you can literally them this thing they say or do is disturbing you but they won't stop. Last year I went to my uncles place to meet some friends near by. My uncle is an asshole and he FORBID me from going out and meeting friends because he is like just stay at home and watch Netflix, don't go out. That's what I was doing my entire lockdown. He bitched to my mother and when I came back home she was furious and I thought enough is enough. So I went on a hunger strike lol. I didn't eat anything for three days. And only then she stopped scolding me.
